# Random password generator

## About this project
This project was coded from scratch based on [Scrimba's project specification](https://www.figma.com/file/NEj9JDycMjF3XKXq7swoc9/Random-Password-Generator-(New-version)?node-id=0%3A1).

The password generator works in the following way:
- It checks for the amount of characters in the "Length" box
- It runs two separate for loops; one for each password
- The passwords are stored in two separate variables
- The passwords are added to the DOM
